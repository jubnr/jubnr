# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Julie!

I'm a Cognitive Scientist with a background in computational neuroscience and a strong interest in applying AI to understand the brain and address meaningful societal challengesâ€”particularly in healthcare and education.

Currently, I'm a Research Assistant at **NeuroSpin (CEA/Meta)**, where I combine **AI and neuroimaging** to decode language from brain activity. Iâ€™m involved in **collecting MEG/fMRI data**, formatting it into reproducible pipelines suitable for AI applications, and performing in-depth neural data analyses.

Previously, I was a Research Engineer at **Inria**, where I developed a [novel method](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroergonomics/articles/10.3389/fnrgo.2024.1290256/full) to study social bonding and inter-brain synchrony in children during remote interactions.

## ðŸ§  Interests

- Neuroimaging (fMRI, fNIRS, EEG & MEG)  
- Building reproducible and scalable analysis pipelines  
- Science communication

## ðŸ”¬ Current Main Projects

- [`brain-gif-generator`](https://github.com/jubnr/brain-gif-generator)
  A simple and fast Streamlit app using MNE-Python to create 
  
- [`MEG-pipeline`](https://github.com/jubnr/MEG-pipeline)  
  End-to-end MEG analysis pipeline: BIDS conversion, preprocessing, source estimation, brain visualizations.

- [`fMRI-quickstart`](https://github.com/jubnr/fMRI_quickstart)  
  Fast pipeline for 7T fMRI preprocessing using DeepPrep (or fMRIPrep for 3T scans) and GLM analysis.
  
## ðŸŽ“ Background
